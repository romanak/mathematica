This submission is the first installment in the electronic publication
of "EXPLORING NEURAL NETWORKS WITH MATHEMATICA", an extensive
collection of instructional Notebooks developed in the last two
year to support two Neural Neworks courses at UCLA. This first
series covers some basic theory and elementary examples of common
neural algorithms.

These Notebooks are intentionally informal and strictly stand-alone.
They are given to students as starting points for exploration and
as initial models for their term notebooks. They do not rely on a
deep knowledge of Mathematica. Priority has been given to readability
and self-documentation.  Within reason, problem variables are given
long self-explanatory names.  Clever programming tricks are avoided
as well as all but the most common opeator symbols.

You are free to access these Notebooks and use them at your own risk
for any non commercial purpose.
